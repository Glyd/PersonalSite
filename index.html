                <div class="content">
                  <p>I am Darius Lewis, a 19 year old student and developer from Manchester, United Kingdom. When I’m not studying at university, or working on exciting projects for the BBC, I am a hobbyist web developer and gamer. I work on many small projects to practise skills that I can transfer to the workplace. I am also beginning to learn graphic design and UX skills. Expressing my creativity has always been great fun for me, and I have found the perfect outlet that allows me to be both creative and productive.</p>

                  <p>I have a lovely cat named Bella who you can read about in the <a href="#images">Image Gallery</a>, and a corn snake who’s yet to be named (check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7bsJCVqGws">this video of him drinking!</a>).</p>

              <h2>Work Experience</h2>
              <div class="content">
                <p>I am currently an Apprentice Software Engineer at the BBC, working in Children’s Web. I help develop the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies">CBeebies</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc">CBBC</a> websites, two of the most popular children’s sites in the United Kingdom. I work in a multi-disciplined team, consisting of 5 developers, one tester, three user experience designers and a product manager. I use Scala, ES6 and CSS to build new and exciting features for our audience.  We work with continuous delivery, always pushing releasable code to get features delivered as quickly and smoothly as possible.</p>
                <p>My previous job was working for Bright Future Software Ltd. as an Apprentice Software Developer, where I worked in a small Agile team working on a daily planner application, followed by a meeting room booking application as requested by the company. I learnt to develop Android applications, as well as performing multiple roles – a product owner, developer and tester.  </p>

                      <div class="image-caption">
                        <p>Nature and travelling are two of my favourite things. Getting out in to the world and seeing everything that’s out there is a huge interest of mine. This year I am travelling to Sweden, and have been making plans to visit Australia. I love visiting different environments, seeing the wildlife and learning the history of the places I go, as well as capturing it all on camera.</p>

                      <div class="image-caption">
                        <p>Gaming has always been an interest for me, and having a strong work ethic I find that it is important to take time to wind down and relax with friends. I connected with old friends and made new ones through gaming, talking to people all over the world whilst having fun. Since it is a relatively cheap hobby, you get to connect with people from all kinds of backgrounds, and it helps you learn a lot about other countries and their culture.</p>

                        <p>My cat, Bella, has been part of my family as long as I can remember. Always following me around and being next to me, it’s almost as if I have a small feline shadow most of the time. No matter what time I come home, she will appear out of seemingly nowhere to roll around and greet me – a perfect “welcome home” after work!</p>
